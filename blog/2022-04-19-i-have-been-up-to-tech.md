If you've been wondering why I haven't posted in a long time: "I have been up to tech!"

I have quite a few projects on the go. Besides [the theme for this site](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/dananke-theme-hugo-dfd/), I have forked and updated a [Node.js project called perfectionist](https://github.com/ben-eb/perfectionist/) [as perfectionist-dfd](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/perfectionist-dfd). I have also contributed to [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and published some demo sites for Hugo modules I use with Dananke. I have also played a little with LEGO® Mindstorms® EV3 as part of a programme for the [MPL MakerPlace](https://midlandlibrary.com/the-mpl-makerplace/).

If you browse around this site, you will see some of my work on enhancing a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [theme which I have forked and was originally called 'Ananke'](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) [I have named my version 'Dananke' as I have made major modifications](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/dananke-theme-hugo-dfd/). I consider it to still be pre-alpha and have not yet 'released' a version with hopes others will find it useful as well. I do, however, experiment with it on my own websites. This is a work in progress and I will be working on it along with the stack of modules which feed it. In future it is my intent to create a good generic theme for Hugo that allows others to change the 'look and feel' of the theme with a minimum of template coding.

Similarly I have done a lot of work on `perfectionist-dfd` because [another project I use (called `hyperlink`)](https://github.com/Munter/hyperlink) depends on it through [a cool project called `assetgraph`](https://github.com/assetgraph/assetgraph), and `perfectionist` has gotten out of date to the point there were unresolved security warnings from GitHub's Dependabot service, with no hope of a fix from the original author. I completely changed the tooling for the project as well as updated it to fit the current API for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) as `perfectionist` is a PostCSS plugin. I have plans to convert the entire code base to the new API, but my most urgent concern was updating it to current versions of Node.js projects while maintaining compatibility with the existing behaviour (so as to not break anything).

Oh, and did I mention changes to my systems and planned changed to my systems?

The trick of course, is to take enough time to write about it here so that hopefully all this work is useful to others, and not just me.
