The page hierarchy was not well suited to the many new posts added since the site started. Therefore I have reorganized it. It fit the original (small) set of pages reasonably well, but I did not anticipate much of the new content which could fit multiple categories at the same time.

I hope you find it easier to find items of interest now.
