About a month ago I made a change to the website layouts that broke the RSS (news) feeds. This is now fixed. This is an object lesson in why a developer should never assume a change is too trivial to cause problems. I did, it did, blech!

Also note that while I haven't written many articles in the past couple of months I have been doing a great deal of work on the backend (those more observant than myself may have noticed various changes). Hopefully this means the site is more effective and that as I work on the articles I've got in my queue, you'll find this site worthwhile.
