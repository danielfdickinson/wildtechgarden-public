An interesting tool that was suggested to the author, and which he has made available as a module for others who wish to use it, is a set of [Hugo Debug Tables](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/hugo-debug-tables) which one can view on the [debug-tables demo website](https://hugo-test-debug-tables.wildtechgarden.ca). The tables provide a comprehensive set if information about the variables that are in play when using the Hugo site generator, on every page or via shortcode, depending on one's preference.

Note that this has been updated from the [First version of Hugo Debug Tables](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/hugoDebugTables) which as been archived and is no longer maintained.
