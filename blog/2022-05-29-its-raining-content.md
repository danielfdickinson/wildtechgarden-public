Ok, not really, but I have (finally) published
[much of the content and assets (downloads/images) of Wild Tech "Garden" in a public repository](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wildtechgarden-public/).

It is my hope that some of this content will prove useful to others (with proper
attribution and sharing with others, as per the [LICENSE](https://github.com/danielfdickinson/wildtechgarden-public/blob/main/LICENSE), of course).

Think of it as my sharing my content on the (legally binding) condition that you correctly attribute and 'share forward' (meaning what you publish based on
my content, you share as I have done).
