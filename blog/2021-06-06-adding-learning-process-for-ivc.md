As we journey with [OVHcloud Canada's](https://ca.ovh.com/manager/) Public Cloud Infrastructure we report on the [trials and tribulations](2021-06-05-terraforming-with-ovh-is-not-paradise/index.md) and the [solutions with which we are experimenting](../devel/infrastructure-via-code/_index.md).

Our [First Steps With The OpenStack SDK](../devel/infrastructure-via-code/2021-06-06-first-steps-with-openstacksdk.md) are showing promise, and in any event we hope you will enjoy the victories and mishaps, and learn something useful along the way.
