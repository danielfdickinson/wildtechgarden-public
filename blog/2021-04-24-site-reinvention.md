I've begun the process of killing off all my WordPress sites and replacing them with sites built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I'm doing this because I've had various issues with WordPress that look like the data has gotten into a bad state. In addition, it's a lot easier for me to edit and manage my site offline and upload it than the WordPress system of editing in the web browser.

In the case of the Wild Tech "Garden", I'm reinventing the site as less of a blog and more of a documentation and project information site. I think this better suits the type of information I've historically included here.

In addition, I have created a separate 'Site News' feed for mentioning updates to pages and administrative matters that tend to be rather short-lived in their usefulness (this is the closest to a blog that this site has).
