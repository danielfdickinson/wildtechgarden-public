As our local infrastructure updates come to an end, we have one more collection of articles.  Today we add setting up an [Intel NUC(-like) Server](/deploy-admin/2021-05-18-intel-nuc-like-server.md) as well as [Hosting a Local Nextcloud](/deploy-admin/2021-05-18-nextcloud.md).

In addition, we add a couple of brief notes. The first is [Moving a PostgreSQL Server](/deploy-admin/2021-05-19-moving-a-postgresql-server.md), and the second covers [Resetting Nextcloud](/deploy-admin/2021-05-19-resetting-nextcloud.md).

While at it, we update [Using XCA to Create Private SSL Certificates](/deploy-admin/2021-05-11-using-xca-to-create-private-ssl-certificates) to include information on adding the certificates to desktop clients so that the servers / private sites can be viewed from user desktops (for users whose desktops are so configured).
