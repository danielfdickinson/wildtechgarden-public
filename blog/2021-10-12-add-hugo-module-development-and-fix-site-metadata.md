Daniel has added a new page about [Hugo Module development using Netlify](../devel/2021-10-12-hugo-module-dev-netlify.md).
In addition he has fixed the site metadata (specifically ~~[Categories]\(/categories)~~ _[AUTHOR'S NOTE: categories have been removed with the theme change]_ and [Tags](/tags)) to have less duplication and more relevance.
