I've begun the process of killing off all my WordPress sites and replacing them with sites built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I'm doing this because I've had various issues with WordPress that look like the data has gotten into a bad state. In addition, it's a lot easier for me to edit and manage my site offline and upload it than the WordPress system of editing in the web browser.

Since I'm doing this, I'm doing weeding and trimming of the site as well, so you may notice some posts are not longer available, and that others have had a bit of refreshing / clean up. It's been well overdue.

I'm also going to be reorganizing the sites on my other domains, but what you saw on Daniel F. Dickinson on ``https://www.danielfdickinson.ca`` is what I was planning on having going forward (though I may change the 'look and feel' aka theme). Around 2021-12-09 I merged ``www.danielfdickinson.ca`` and ``www.wildtechgarden.ca``, still using Hugo but with a different theme.

I hope you enjoy the refreshed (and hopefully faster, site).

[**AUTHOR'S NOTE**: _Edited 2021-10-23 to reflect changes in reality_]

On a side note, you may be interested to know that this site ~~is currently~~ **was** built using a new theme I am working on. It's a Hugo Minimal Test Theme, which is to say a theme built for debugging [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) sites.  Despite being a test theme, the 'silly little style' I created to make the theme more palatable is reasonably pleasant, so I though I'd use it for this site.

**NB** The ~~Hugo Minimal Test Theme~~ no longer has the the 'silly little style' mentioned here, but I have ~~[new Demo Site Theme]\(``https://hugo-dfd-demo-site-theme.wildtechgarden.ca``)~~ which does have the 'silly little style'.
