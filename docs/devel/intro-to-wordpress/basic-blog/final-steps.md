![Final appearance of blog front page -- two posts in bordered boxes with a menu on the top left and the site name in the top right](../../../assets/images/2021/01/index-45_1-png-1.png)

* The front page now looks as depicted above.
* Now we delete the ‘Hello world!’ post.
* This is like deleting a page but one selects ‘Posts|All Posts’ instead of ‘Pages|All Pages’.
* Deleting a page with comments automatically deletes the comments.
